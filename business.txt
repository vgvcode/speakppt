@Our business is growing significantly in Australia and Canada

#heading How did we lower manufacturing costs?
#paragraph
@We have deployed a new automation software, in our assembly lines, in our factories in Australia and Canada
@This software reduces the need for manual labour, reduces errors and increases throughput by 15%
@The net result of all of this is lower operating costs and reduced wastage
@We plan to deploy this change globally, in the next few months

#heading Challenges ahead
#paragraph
@While we are continuing to grow, I would like to highlight some of our challenges ahead
@Increased competition from local players.
Many local players are producing widgets similar to ours, that work well in their regions.
@Slow rate of innovation in product design.
We have come up with only 3 new innovations in products, in the last one year.
Our leading competitor is innovating at the rate of 20 new products per year.
@Increase in manufacturing costs and cost of raw materials in the USA.
Our manufacturing operations in North America, are more costly than in many other countries.
Our raw materials sourced in the USA, are also more costly than those sourced in other countries.
